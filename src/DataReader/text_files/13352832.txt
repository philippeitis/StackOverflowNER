I've got this as XML:
CODE_BLOCK: Q_1 (code omitted for annotation)
I've got this as php:
CODE_BLOCK: Q_1 (code omitted for annotation)
Now the problem is this, I'm forced to have $testcase in a lowercase form (defaultimage) BUT in the XML file the name of the child is: defaultImage (note the uppercase I)
Question: How can I handle all the children as lowercases?

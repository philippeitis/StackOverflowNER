While you cannot prevent usage of those inherited members to my knowledge, you should be able to hide them from IntelliSense using the EditorBrowsableAttribute:
CODE_BLOCK: Q_1 (code omitted for annotation)
Edit: Just saw this in the documentation comments, which makes it kinda useless for this purpose:
OP_BLOCK: (output omitted for annotation)
